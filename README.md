# CSV Schema
A lot of people love Excel. Accounting people, marketing guys or like in my case game designers.
They create spreadsheets in wild formats and it is now your task to get that data in your application.
Sadly the possibility to create complex nested data structures with Excel and import them in a proper format
are very limited. The simplest way is usually to tell people to save their stuff as CSV.
And this is the time where this library comes into play.
